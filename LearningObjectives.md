# Learning Objectives

## Description of the Internship: 
I will be working with BUDK Inc. which is an online ecommerce company that sells a variety of items but specializes in knives. The company hosts and maintains their own websites as well as sells on Amazon and EBAY. With the company, I will be working with the SQL and C# programming languages. I have taken Java I, Java 2 and Database Design and Development through my course work. This will allow me to learn another Object-Oriented programming language in C# as well as advance my skills in the SQL programming language. Justin Artz, Director of IT will be my mentor and provide me with books and one-on-one training to enhance my knowledge. He will also evaluate my progress and performance and suggest areas of improvement.

## Learning Objective 1:
**Enhance my program design skills**


Justin wants a scheduled report built that reflects the products sold by the company at Amazon using the SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio applications. I will be provided specific information to be contained in this report, I will create the stored procedure SQL script and pull this information into Visual Studio to create the scheduled Excel document utilizing C# coding language. I will work with Justin as well as the IT team to ensure understanding of the development environment and design compliance. The IT team meets once a week and I will attend these meetings to ensure timely deliverance of my project and solicit feedback and direction when needed.

## Learning Objective 2:
**Learn a new programming language**

I will be learning C# which is an Object-Oriented programming language. This will allow me to work hands on with real-world data as well as have the ability to utilize my skills learned from my Java courses on programming and problem solving. Justin's IT department utilizes Microsoft Visual Studio and the C# programming language. By working with him, I will be able to work in Visual studio to build the scheduled report referenced in LO 1 from scratch using the C# language.

## Learning Objective 3:
**Experience an actual testing environment**

The building of this report will require extensive testing of my SQL script as well as my C# coding. This testing will allow me to gain hands-on troubleshooting knowledge and create a mental repository of frequent programming bugs that will not only make me a better programmer but also a faster one. Justin states that the Visual Studio program is local to my workstation so I will have the ability of unlimited testing opportunities. Because of this, my programming and problem-solving skills will be greatly enhanced.
